# Hooks - Rapid Development PHP Framework
 Hooks is a rapid development PHP MVC framework. It encompasses the MVC with partials and view components. It has in-built Database Helpers that help you develop apps in PHP rapidly.

# The idea
I was a very big fan of the MVC-framework implemented by ASP.Net. This framwork implements very similar pattern and should be familiar to ASP.Net developers.
